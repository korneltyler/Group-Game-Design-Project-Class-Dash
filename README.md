# CSCI437 Group 1 Project
Class Dash is a side-scrolling platformer where the goal is for the student to make it to their final exams on time. It has many obstacles and distractions that the player must avoid, as well as collectibles that can help them out. The game takes you through many of the locations at the College of William & Mary, making it especially interesting for current or former students.

## Plot Overview
You are a senior at the College of William & Mary entering your last week of finals. In order to graduate, you must make it to all of your finals on time! At the start of each day, you will see your exam start time and a clock will display your current time as you dash to class. While traversing various campus locations such as Swem, The Sunken Gardens, and ISC, you must avoid distractions and obstacles that can slow you down. Occupational hazards like puddles, construction, and loose bricks can slow your movements and people can shoot sound waves at you that will slow you down and eventually cause you to stop and engage in conversation briefly. You must work to avoid these obstacles by moving left and right, jumping, and “shooting down” people by telling them you can’t talk right now. If you make it to your class before the given exam start time, you pass that level and can move on to the next day. After completing your Monday-Friday exams, you will finally graduate.
